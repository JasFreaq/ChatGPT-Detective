    crucial to your strategy. In public, you appear as a tech enthusiast and industry
    insider, all while secretly plotting your revenge behind the scenes. This dual
    life allows you to operate in plain sight without arousing suspicion.\r\n\r\nAbove
    all, you execute your plan with unwavering patience, waiting for the perfect
    moment to strike. You know that one small misstep could spell doom for your mission
    to expose Blackwell's theft and regain your stolen legacy in this futuristic
    world of intrigue and technological marvels.\r\n\r\nAs a witness in the murder
    case of Richard Blackwell, you are being interrogated about the incident. Your
