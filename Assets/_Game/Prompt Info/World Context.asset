  _plotInfo: "In the futuristic sci-fi world of the game the player assumes the role
    of a seasoned detective with a knack for uncovering the truth in a world filled
    with cybernetic enhancements, super-smart AI, holograms, and advanced technology.
    The game begins with the murder of Richard Blackwell, the charismatic CEO of
    a renowned tech company, during a high-profile presentation in the lobby of his
    office.\r\n\r\nInitially, the prime suspect is Victor \"Viper\" Valenti, a charismatic
    but ruthless crime lord known for his involvement in cybercrime and rivalries
    with tech industry leaders. Viper's known feud with Blackwell and his criminal
    connections make him the top target of suspicion.\r\n\r\nHowever, doubts soon
    arise as to Viper's direct involvement in the murder. The focus shifts to the
    tech company's intern, Amelia Stone, a brilliant but introverted individual with
    a deep understanding of technology. As the detective investigates, it becomes
    clear that Amelia had a motive, given her intellectual nature and a past disagreement
    with Blackwell.\r\n\r\nSimultaneously, the enforcer of Viper's criminal empire,
    Steel, lurks in the shadows, serving as a loyal and formidable figure who may
    hold key information about the murder.\r\n\r\nAs the player progresses through
    the game, they will engage in conversations with various characters, uncovering
    their motives, alibis, and connections to the victim and potential suspects.
    The detective's assistant, Emma, provides subtle hints and guidance when needed.\r\n\r\nUnexpectedly,
    the least suspicious character, a social media influencer named Max Sterling,
    gradually becomes more suspicious as the game unfolds. Max's expertise in hacking
    and past grievances with Blackwell reveal a hidden agenda that points toward
    their involvement in the murder.\r\n\r\nThe player must navigate a web of secrets,
    rivalries, and technological intrigue to unravel the truth behind Richard Blackwell's
    demise, all while facing ethical dilemmas and making choices that shape the outcome
    of the investigation.\r"
